      Set attribute foo to a new value. Note that this method takes a
      polymorphic reference (`void *`) as its first argument, which could point
      to structs of different types.

      This also means that high-level bindings might give you the choice to
      call this method directly on an instance, or with an explicit receiver.

    <method name = "set bar">
        This method takes an argument type of the (descriptive) type `foo`, but
        resolving it to a corresponding C type will be skipped because it's
        overridden to `foobarbaz_t` by the `c_type` attribute.
