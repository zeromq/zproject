    <!-- Jenkins target creates jenkins pipeline
         Pipeline file is not overwriten if it exists.

         Your projects can build under a docker container OR agents
         matched by a label OR under an "any" agent by default.
         If you specify a complex label expression, be sure to use
         XML escaping of the amperesand character (&amp;) if some of
         your tooling expects project.xml to be valid XML (the GSL
         parser accepts a verbatim amperesand character as well).

         The agent_single option is a flag that enables parallel
         builds of this component on several agents (specified by
         label or docker) vs. a sequential build on a single agent.

         Similarly, a check_sequential option can be defined so that
         self-testing stages would run sequentially. This can be needed
         at early stages of a project's evolution, where hardcoding is
         prevalent so parallel runs in same operating environemnt cause
         conflicts to each other. Ultimately a project should remove
         this flag ;)

         The build_* and test_* options influence the default setting
         of corresponding build arguments for the project. You can
         still run a custom Jenkins Build with Arguments with other
         checkboxes clicked, e.g. while developing a missing feature.
         If not explicitly set to 0, most of these options are assumed
         "true", as normally a project should be capable of all these
         aspects. Note however that a project with no classes marked
         "stable" would by default not test non-DRAFT builds as the
         configure.ac script would have no support for those anyway.

         The require_gitignore option (enabled by default) also causes
         the test to fail, rather than warn, if untracked or changed
         files are found as a result of some build or test stage.

         Also note, that after successful build and test steps, the
         job generated by this Jenkinsfile can optionally trigger
         some other job specific to your installation of a Jenkins
         server, to handle the deployment of tested code (whichever
         way you'd define that). For this optional feature, your
         Jenkins master should define (and propagate to its agents)
         the environment values DEFAULT_DEPLOY_BRANCH_PATTERN (regex)
         and DEFAULT_DEPLOY_JOB_NAME (note to start with a slash for
         absolute naming; jobs in a folder may use relative paths too).
         That job should accept parameters DEPLOY_GIT_URL (URL of repo),
         DEPLOY_GIT_BRANCH (name for decision-making), DEPLOY_GIT_COMMIT
         (actual commit to check out and shrink-wrap into packaging.

         The test_install check tries to "make DESTDIR=... install" where
         the DESTDIR is test_install_DESTDIR value (must be an absolute
         path), or BUILD_DIR/tmp/_inst if the option is unspecified/empty.

         The test_cppcheck is different, as it calls the "cppcheck" tool
         which may be not installed on a particular deployment, so by
         default this option is disabled if not set explicitly. Same idea
         goes for build_docs as it requires asciidoc and xmlto toolkits.

         The triggers_pollSCM option sets up the pipeline-generated job
         for regular polling of the original SCM repository, using the
         Jenkins cron syntax. The default is approximately every 5 minutes
         with a spread to minimize burst-loads vs quiet times. An explicit
         empty string disables polling, so you'd only run the job manually.
         Note that the most frequent working setting is "H/2", NOT a "H/1".

         The use_test_timeout option sets up the default timeout for test
         steps (further configurable at run-time as a build argument).
         Generally unit tests should not take pathologically long, so the
         default of 10 minutes should commonly suffice even for distchecks.
         If your selftests are known to take a lot of time, set this option.

         A use_test_retry option allows to retry each failing test step
         for the specified amount of attempts; it is deemed good if the
         test passes at least once. This option should not normally need
         to be used -- only if selftests somehow depend on environmental
         circumstances and fail occasionally but not always. Ultimately,
         project developers should find and fix the issue in tests (or in
         the production codebase) so it always works on the first try,
         bulletproof.

         As a workaround for some versions of Jenkins, if your project uses
         "weird" (generally non-ASCII) filenames in the build directory,
         their removal with Pipeline deleteDir() can fail even though it
         should not. If this bites you, set use_deleteDir_rm_first=1 in
         the project, so the OS native "rm" is tried first.
