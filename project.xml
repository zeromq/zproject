<!-- 
    The project.xml generates build environments for:

        * android
        * autotool
        * cmake
        * mingw32
        * cygwin
        * vs2008
        * vs2010
        * vs2012
        * vs2013

    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source 
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

    name := The name of your project
    description := A short description for your project
    script := The gsl script to generate all the stuff !!! DO NOT CHANGE !!!
    email := The email address where to reach you project e.g. mailinglist.

    name = "myproject"
    description = "My Project that will change the world."
    script = "zproject.gsl"

        Current version of your project.

        Specify which other projects this depends on.
        These projects must be known by zproject, and the list of
        known projects is maintained in the zproject_known_projects.xml model.
        You need not specify subdependencies if they are implied.
    <use project = "zyre" min_major= "1" min_minor = "1" min_patch = "0" />

    <!-- Header Files
         name := The name the header file to include without file ending

        Classes, if the class header or source file doesn't exist this will

    <!--
        Actors, are build using the simple actor framework from czmq. If the 
        actors class header or source file doesn't exist this will generate a
        skeleton for them. The generated test method of the actor will teach
        you how to use them. Also have a look at the czmq docs to learn more
        about actors.

    <!-- 
        Models that we build using GSL. 
        This will generate a 'make code' target to build the models.
    <model name = "sockopts" />
    <model name = "zgossip" />
    <model name = "zgossip_msg" />

        If a model should be generated using a specific gsl script,
        this can be set through the script attribute:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl" />

        Additional parameters to the script can be set via nested
        param elements:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl">
        <param name = "root_path" value = "../main" />
