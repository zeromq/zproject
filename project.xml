By default it would be "xenial" as of now.
            <option name="distcheck" value="0" /> "0" will disable run of make distcheck in Travis CI, "2" will enable it as a special testcase allowed to fail (default: 1 to enable and require to pass)
            <option name="use_pkg_deps_prereqs_source" value="0" /> "0" will disable use of use_pkg_deps_prereqs_source list in Travis CI and so cause rebuild of everything from scratch (default: 1, recently packaged prereqs must exist then)
            <option name="use_cmake" value="0" /> "0" will disable use of CMake recipes in Travis CI (default: 1)
            <option name="require_gitignore" value="1" /> "1" will require that the workspace is clean with regard to .gitignore settings after build (default: 0)
            <option name="clangformat_allow_failures" value="0" /> "1" will generate the option allowing non-fatal failure of clang-format test in Travis CI (default: 1)
            <option name="clangformat_require_good" value="0" /> "1" will generate the option allowing to report and not ignore failure of clang-format test in Travis CI (otherwise "0" hides the failure, and devs must look in test logs) (default: same as allow_failures)
            <option name="clangformat_implem" value="cmake|autotools" /> will pick one of two implems of the clang-format test in Travis CI (cmake is default and faster if available, since autotools needs to configure first)
            <option name="check_abi_compliance" value="0" /> "1" will compare the currently tested commit's ABI to the one in a "latest_release" branch or tag, using packaged prerequisites. Due to these limitations, the option is off by default.
            <option name="check_zproject" value="0" /> "1" will regenerate the zproject of the tested commit, and will verify that nothing changed, "2" will enable it as a special testcase allowed to fail. Many projects do customize their originally generated codebase, so to avoid surprises this option is off by default.
            <option name="shadow_gcc" value="0" /> "1" will enable builds with warnings configured as fatal in additional recent versions of GCC, and "2" will make failures in these cases non-fatal so you can take time to modernize your code with modern best practices in mind. This is off "0" by default.
            <option name="shadow_clang" value="0" /> "1" will enable builds with warnings configured as fatal in additional recent versions of CLANG, and "2" will make failures in these cases non-fatal so you can take time to modernize your code with modern best practices in mind.

         Your projects can build under a docker container OR agents
         matched by a label OR under an "any" agent by default.
         If you specify a complex label expression, be sure to use
         XML escaping of the ampersand character (&amp;) if some of
         your tooling expects project.xml to be valid XML (the GSL
         parser accepts a verbatim ampersand character as well).

         The agent_single option is a flag that enables parallel
         builds of this component on several agents (specified by
         label or docker) vs. a sequential build on a single agent.

         Similarly, a check_sequential option can be defined so that
         self-testing stages would run sequentially. This can be needed
         at early stages of a project's evolution, where hard-coding is
         prevalent so parallel runs in same operating environment cause
         conflicts to each other. Ultimately a project should remove
         this flag ;)

         The build_* and test_* options influence the default setting
         of corresponding build arguments for the project. You can
         still run a custom Jenkins Build with Arguments with other
         checkboxes clicked, e.g. while developing a missing feature.
         If not explicitly set to 0, most of these options are assumed
         "true", as normally a project should be capable of all these
         aspects. Note however that a project with no classes marked
         "stable" would by default not test non-DRAFT builds as the
         configure.ac script would have no support for those anyway.

         The require_gitignore option (enabled by default) also causes
         the test to fail, rather than warn, if untracked or changed
         files are found as a result of some build or test stage.

         Also note, that after successful build and test steps, the
         job generated by this Jenkinsfile can optionally trigger
         some other job specific to your installation of a Jenkins
         server, to handle the deployment of tested code (whichever
         way you'd define that). For this optional feature, your
         Jenkins master should define (and propagate to its agents)
         the environment values DEFAULT_DEPLOY_BRANCH_PATTERN (regex)
         and DEFAULT_DEPLOY_JOB_NAME (note to start with a slash for
         absolute naming; jobs in a folder may use relative paths too).
         That job should accept parameters DEPLOY_GIT_URL (URL of repo),
         DEPLOY_GIT_BRANCH (name for decision-making), DEPLOY_GIT_COMMIT
         (actual commit to check out and shrink-wrap into packaging.

         The test_install check tries to "make DESTDIR=... install" where
         the DESTDIR is test_install_DESTDIR value (must be an absolute
         path), or BUILD_DIR/tmp/_inst if the option is unspecified/empty.

         The test_cppcheck is different, as it calls the "cppcheck" tool
         which may be not installed on a particular Jenkins deployment.
         The `make cppcheck` recipe is safe to call in either case, so by
         default this option is enabled if not set explicitly. Same idea
         goes for build_docs as it requires asciidoc and xmlto toolkits,
         except it is off by default to avoid churning CPUs with no tools.
         A further dist_docs enables preparation of a "dist" tarball from
         the workspace configured with docs, so you can forward it to the
         publishing helper job and avoid rebuilding man pages for packaging.

         Similarly, a test_check_clang_format requires an external tool,
         the clang-format-5.0 (or newer) to process the codebase and decide
         if it is stylish. By default the test is enabled but not required
         to pass (is just informative) and will run if the tool is available
         in the build system. Eventually, a project should define and uphold
         its coding style -- then this test can become one of requirements
         for new pull requests.

         The triggers_pollSCM option sets up the pipeline-generated job
         for regular polling of the original SCM repository, using the
         Jenkins cron syntax. The default is approximately every 5 minutes
         with a spread to minimize burst-loads vs quiet times. An explicit
         empty string disables polling, so you'd only run the job manually.
         Note that the most frequent working setting is "H/2", NOT a "H/1".

         On the Jenkins setup used by generated projects, sometimes it was
         re-scheduling the same commits over and over and even overlapping.
         Usually this was linked to some lagginess of the build system or
         its internet connection, but the result was a growing queue of
         same (and redundant) builds. To remedy this, projects can set a
         few experimental options now (and regenerate their Jenkinsfile):
         * use_earlymilestone -- uses a milestone to cancel builds that
            got to it later than the running one
         * use_deploymilestone -- uses a milestone to cancel builds that
            got to the 'deploy if appropriate' phase later than the
            running one
         * use_build_nonconcurrent -- sets a disableConcurrentBuilds option
         * use_checkout_explicit -- sets a skipDefaultCheckout option and
            defines a step to check out code explicitly; it is believed
            this may better succeed in recording which commits are already
            being processed by the server

         The use_test_timeout option sets up the default timeout for test
         steps (further configurable at run-time as a build argument).
         Generally unit tests should not take pathologically long, so the
         default of 30 minutes should commonly suffice even for distchecks.
         If your selftests are known to take a lot of time, perhaps due to
         using an occasionally overloaded Jenkins CI farm, set this option.

         A use_test_retry option allows to retry each failing test step
         for the specified amount of attempts; it is deemed good if the
         test passes at least once. This option should not normally need
         to be used -- only if selftests somehow depend on environmental
         circumstances and fail occasionally but not always. Ultimately,
         project developers should find and fix the issue in tests (or in
         the production codebase) so it always works on the first try,
         bulletproof.

         As a workaround for some versions of Jenkins, if your project uses
         "weird" (generally non-ASCII) filenames in the build directory,
         their removal with Pipeline deleteDir() can fail even though it
         should not. If this bites you, set use_deleteDir_rm_first=1 in
         the project, so the OS native "rm" is tried first.

         The two options do_cleanup_after_build (for parallelized tests)
         and do_cleanup_after_job control whether the pipeline would by
         default remove the build/test subdirectory after successful end
         of stage, and/or cleans the build workspace after the whole job
         succeeded, respectively. If not set, cleanup is enabled for both
         and in either case the active options are among build parameters.
         In opposite fashion, a do_cleanup_after_failed_build is disabled
         by default to allow post-mortem inspection of errors on CI server.
         You might want to keep the built sources to analyze the behavior
         of your build recipes in a particular environment, thought at a
         risk of using excessive disk space there. In case of failure the
         workspace remains on disk to make an in-place analysis possible,
         and would eat space until you clean it up manually or it would
         expire according to your Jenkins old-build retention policies.
