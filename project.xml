    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

    script := The gsl script to generate all the stuff !!! DO NOT CHANGE !!!
    name := The name of your project (optional)
    description := A short description for your project (optional)
    email := The email address where to reach you (optional)
    repository := git repository holding project (optional)

        Dependencies that support the autotools build system are automatically

        Classes, if the class header or source file doesn't exist, this will
        generate a skeletons for them.

        Actors, are built using the simple actor framework from czmq. If the
        actors class header or source file doesn't exist, this will generate a
        skeleton for them. The generated test method of the actor will teach
        you how to use them. Also have a look at the CZMQ docs to learn more
        about actors.
        Use selftest = "0" to not generate selftest code

        Additional parameters to the script can be set via nested
